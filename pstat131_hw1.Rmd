## Main Ideas

### Question 1

Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

### Question 2

Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.

### Question 3

Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.

### Question 4

As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

Descriptive models:

Inferential models:

Predictive models:

### Question 5

Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

Describe how the bias-variance trade off is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

### Question 6

A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.
